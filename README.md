﻿# pythonImageConverterThis is a basic tool for converting images from on format to another, for instants BMP to JPEG.1. When first run it will ask for a file, which will be either a single file or a folder.2. Then it will ask for the input file type. This may seem redundant, and could be worked around in some cases, but for now it is necessary.3. Then it will ask for the file type you would like it to output as.4. Finally it will make a copy of the file in the selected format.5. Then it will ask for another file. If you are done you can either type end, or just close it.
